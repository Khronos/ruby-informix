1. Building requirements

  All platforms
	* Informix CSDK 2.90

  Windows
	* Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0

  Unix
	* Any ANSI C compiler


2. Building instructions

  After setting the INFORMIXDIR environment variable appropriately run:

    $ ruby extconf.rb
    $ make
    # make install


  Note: use nmake instead of make on Windows platforms

  If Informix libraries or header files are not in their standard locations
under INFORMIXDIR, use --with-informix-include and --with-informix-lib to
provide them, like this:

  $ ruby extconf.rb --with-informix-include=C:\somewhere\incl\esql --with-informix-lib=C:\somewhere_else\lib
  $ nmake
  $ nmake install


3. Gem installation

  After setting the INFORMIXDIR environment variable appropriately run:

  # gem install ruby-informix
