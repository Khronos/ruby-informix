Send me an e-mail if you have [un]succesfully tested Ruby/Informix on another
platform.

== Installation

=== Requirements

* Informix CSDK 2.81 or above

If you want to build Ruby/Informix instead of installing a precompiled gem,
you will also need:

* Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0, for Windows or
* an ANSI C compiler, for UNIX and Linux

=== Rubygem installation

gem install ruby-informix

== Documentation

RDoc and ri documentation is automatically installed. It can also be found
online at:

http://ruby-informix.rubyforge.org/doc

== Examples

* Connecting to a database

    db = Informix.connect('stores')

* Fetching all records from a table

    cur = db.cursor('select * from stock')
    cur.open
    records = cur.fetch_all
    cur.drop # or close, if you want to reopen it later

* Same thing, with blocks

    records = db.cursor('select * from stock') do |cur|
      cur.open
      cur.fetch_all
    end

* Inserting records

    stmt = db.prepare('insert into state values(?, ?)')
    stmt.execute('CA', 'California')
    stmt.call('NM', 'New Mexico')
    stmt['TX', 'Texas']

* Iterating over a table using a hash (shortcut)

    db.each_hash('select * from customers') do |cust|
      puts "#{cust['firstname']} #{cust['lastname']}"
    end

== Data types supported

  Informix                          Ruby
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  SMALLINT, INT, INT8, FLOAT,      Numeric
  SERIAL, SERIAL8
  CHAR, NCHAR, VARCHAR, NVARCHAR   String
  DATE                             Date
  DATETIME                         Time
  INTERVAL                         Informix::IntervalYTM, Informix::IntervalDTS
  DECIMAL, MONEY                   BigDecimal
  BOOL                             TrueClass, FalseClass
  BYTE, TEXT                       StringIO, String
  CLOB, BLOB                       Informix::Slob


NULL values can be inserted and are retrieved as +nil+.

BYTE and TEXT are retrieved as Srings, but for supplying them as input
parameters, a StringIO object, or a anyother IO-like object that provides
a #read method must be used.

Strings can be used in the cases where Informix accepts them for non-character
data types, like DATE, DATETIME, INTERVAL, BOOL, DECIMAL and MONEY


== Recommendations

* use blocks to release Informix resources automatically as soon as possible,
  or use #drop
* you can optimize cursor execution by changing the size of fetch and insert
  buffers, setting the environment variable FET_BUF_SIZE to up to 32767.
