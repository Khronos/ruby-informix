1. Supported platforms

Ruby/Informix has been tested succesfully on the following platforms:

Operating System    Architecture       Informix	      CSDK
-------------------------------------------------------------
Solaris 9              SPARC           9.40FC6       2.90UC3
Linux Fedora Core 4     i386          10.00.UC3R1    2.90UC4
Linux Fedora Core 5     i386          10.00.UC3R1    2.90UC4
SuSE Linux 9.3          i386           9.30TC1       2.90UC4
Windows XP Pro SP       i386           9.40TC3       2.90TC1
Windows XP              i386           9.30TC1       2.90TC4

Send me an e-mail if you have [un]succesfully tested Ruby/Informix on another
platform.


2. Data types

All built-in data types are supported, except interval. As you would expect,
numeric, string and boolean data types are mapped to their respective objects
in Ruby; DATE, DATETIME and NULL are mapped to Date, Time and nil respectively.

The notable exception is TEXT/BYTE columns, where Ruby/Informix expects an
IO-based (File) or IO-like (StringIO) object as input, and returns an String
object as output.


3. Recommendations

* use #drop for prepared statements and cursors to release Informix resources
* you can optimize cursor execution by changing the fetch and insert buffers,
  setting the environment variable FET_BUF_SIZE to up to 32767 for Informix 9.x,
  or BIG_FET_BUF_SIZE for Informix 10.x


4. Caveats

* INTERVAL not implemented yet
* Cursors must be closed before reopening them
* Only one connection at a time is supported
