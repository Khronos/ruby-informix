Linux Fedora Core 4     i386          10.00.UC3R1    2.90UC4
Linux Fedora Core 5     i386          10.00.UC3R1    2.90UC4

Send me an e-mail if you have [un]succesfully tested Ruby/Informix on another
platform.


2. Documentation

Documentation generated by RDoc for each class, module and method can be found
under the doc/ directory in this distribution and at the following web address:

http://ruby-informix.rubyforge.org/doc/

Examples of use can be found at:

http://ruby-informix.rubyforge.org


3. Data types

All built-in data types are supported, except interval. As you would expect,
numeric, string and boolean data types are mapped to their respective objects
in Ruby; DATE, DATETIME and NULL are mapped to Date, Time and nil respectively.

The notable exception is TEXT/BYTE columns, where Ruby/Informix expects an
IO-based (File) or IO-like (StringIO) object as input, and returns an String
object as output.

An Slob class exists in the Informix module for working with Smart Large
Objects (CLOB/BLOB).


4. Recommendations

* use #drop for prepared statements and cursors to release Informix resources
* you can optimize cursor execution by changing the fetch and insert buffers,
  setting the environment variable FET_BUF_SIZE to up to 32767 for Informix 9.x,
  or BIG_FET_BUF_SIZE for Informix 10.x


5. Caveats

* INTERVAL not implemented yet

6. Support

Feel free to send me bug reports, feature requests, comments, patches or
questions to my mailbox or Ruby/Informix's forums at Rubyforge.
