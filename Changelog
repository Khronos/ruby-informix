0.4.0  
------------------
New features:
	* Support for multiple connections to databases
	* Support for scroll cursors. Methods available:
		- [], abs (accept negative indexes and [start, length] pairs, similar
			to Array objects)
		- prev, next, first, last, current
		- prev_hash, next_hash, first_hash, last_hash, current_hash
		- abs!, prev!, next!, first!, last!, current!
		- abs_hash!, prev_hash!, next_hash!, first_hash!, last_hash!,
		  current_hash!


0.3.0  11/26/2006
------------------
New features:
	* Initial support for Smart Large Objects (BLOB/CLOB).
	  Operations supported:
		- new
		- open, close
		- read, write
		- seek, tell
		- truncate
	* Database#columns now also returns the extended id (xid)
	* small documentation improvements and fixes


0.2.1  11/11/2006
------------------
Bugs fixed:
	* changing free() for xfree() avoids crashes on Windows XP SP1. Noticed
	  by Dinko <dsrkoc at helix hr>


0.2.0  04/24/2006
------------------
New features:
	* Methods added to SequentialCursor:

		- fetch_hash_many(n), fetch_hash_all
		- each_by(n), each_hash_by(n)
		- fetch!, fetch_hash!, each!, each_hash!

	  where !-methods reduce object creation by reusing the same result
	  object in each call

Remarks:
	* fetch*many and fetch*all methods now return [] instead of nil when
	  no records are found

Bugs fixed:
	* When freeing a cursor that was opened but never used, a segmentation
	  fault occurred


0.1.0  04/10/2006
-------------------
Features:
	* Support for all built-in data types, except INTERVAL
	* immediate statements
	* prepared statements
	* select cursors and bulk inserts (insert cursors)
	* transactions
	* #columns method for retrieving column information
	* rows retrieved as arrays or hashes
	* IO-based and IO-like (StringIO) objects for storing a BYTE/TEXT
	  column, and retrieved as a String object
	* NULL, DATE and DATETIME mapped to nil, Date and Time objects and
	  viceversa
	* #drop method for freeing Informix resources immediatly
	* source code documented with RDoc

Caveats:
	* INTERVAL not supported
	* cursors must be closed before reopening them
	* only one open connection at a time is supported
